# COVID-19 stats for Allegheny County, PA

I update the [CSV file](covid-19-allegheny-county.csv) every day at 11 AM 
when I receive an official email from the mailing list I signed up for at
[Allegheny Alerts](http://www.alleghenycounty.us/alerts).

You can view my graphs generated from this data at
