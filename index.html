                      <p>Dr. Levine issued an order requiring anyone who visits from another state to have a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours prior to entering the commonwealth.

                      <p>If someone cannot get a test or chooses not to, they must quarantine for 14 days upon arrival in Pennsylvania.

                      <p>Pennsylvanians visiting other states are required to have a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours prior to their return to the commonwealth or to quarantine for 14 days upon return to Pennsylvania.

                      <p>This order, which takes effect on Friday, November 20, does not apply to people who commute to and from another state for work or medical treatment.
                          <li>
                              <p>Masks are required to be worn indoors and outdoors if you are away from your home.
                              <p>When outdoors, a mask must be worn if you are not able to remain physically distant (at least 6 feet away) from someone not in your household the entire time you are outdoors.
                              <p>When indoors, masks will now be required even if you are physically distant from members not in your household. This means that even if you are able to be 6 feet apart, you will need to wear a mask while inside if with people other than members of your household.
                              <p>This order applies to every indoor facility, including homes, retail establishments, gyms, doctorsâ€™ offices, public transportation, and anywhere food is prepared, packaged or served.
