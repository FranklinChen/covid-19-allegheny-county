              Thu Jul 02: Allegheny County order: one-week closure of bars, restaurants, casinos
            </summary>
            <p>You can read the full <a href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/uploadedFiles/Allegheny_Home/Health_Department/Resources/COVID-19/Docs/ACHD%20COVID-19%20Control%20Measure%20Order%207-2-2020.pdf">official order</a>.
            <p>
              Health Department Director Dr. Debra Bogen today
              announced that additional mitigation measures are being
              taken in Allegheny County to further stem the spread of
              coronavirus cases in the county. The new order calls for
              a one-week closure of bars, restaurants and casinos and
              the cancellation of all activities or events over 25
              people for that same one-week time period. Food
              establishments may still offer take-out and delivery
              during that time period. The order takes effect
              at <time datetime="2020-07-03 00:01">12:01 a.m. on
              Friday, July 3, 2020</time>.
            <p>
              In addition to the order, Dr. Bogen also recommended a
              voluntary stay-at-home protocol for residents of the
              county. While not part of the order, limiting travel to
              necessities and other mitigation measures is intended to
              further reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our county.
