            <p>See this <a href="https://mcba.autonlab.org/covidashboard/public">dashboard for Allegheny County wastewater virus level</a>, because wastewater virus level measurements are more accurate in reflecting the state of community transmission than reported case counts.

                July 12, 2022: I am eventually going to stop updating graphs here because reported case counts are now less useful because of severe undercounting. For example, consider the wastewater measurements in San Francisco compared to reported cases.
