                <li>Thu Nov 19: CDC advisory for Thanksgiving (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays/thanksgiving.html">full details here</a>). Key points:
                    <p>
                        More than 1 million COVID-19 cases were reported in the United States over the last 7 days.</p>

                    <p>
                        As cases continue to increase rapidly across the United States, the safest way to celebrate Thanksgiving is to celebrate at home with the people you live with.</p>

                    <p>
                        Gatherings with family and friends who do not live with you can increase the chances of getting or spreading COVID-19 or the flu.</p>
